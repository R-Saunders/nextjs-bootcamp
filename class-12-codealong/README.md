# Practice API routes

This is a code along done to learn API routes.

You follow a similar file structure to pages. You start by creating an api folder inside of app and then each set of routes is contained inside a route.ts file inside of either the route (for access at /api) or in its own folder (for access at /api/FOLDER_NAME).
